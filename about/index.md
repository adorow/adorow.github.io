I'm a Software Engineer, born and raised in Brazil. I got my degree in Computer Science at Fundação Universidade Regional de Blumenau (FURB).

Since then I moved out to Dublin, Ireland for a year, and then to Munich, Germany where I currently live.

I'm very much into programming languages and functional programming. My work experience has been mostly on Java, and I'm always keen on learning, and have experienced with applying functional programming ideas a lot in the work I do on other languages.

I am also interested in music, sports (mainly football, volleyball) and travelling.
